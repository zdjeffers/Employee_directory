# Employee_directory
Employee Directory uitilizing a random person generator API and, for the first time, React!

### Introduction:
This application is my first attempt at creating a react app! This utilizes a random person generating API. There is also sorting functionality by name in either ascending or decending order. On top of that, it dynamically uses a search bar if there is a specific piece of information you would like to search with.
